# silt

Silt is an isolated lightweight tensor library for easy inclusion in projects that use CUDA with Python bindings.

Note that this library doesn't implement complicated operations or features like autodifferentiation to provide a clean interface.

The goal is to be super lightweight with minimal compile times and easy inclusion into CMake projects.
